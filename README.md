# Postman to Swagger

This is a simple Python script aimed at transforming a Postman
documentation (previously exported as a JSON file) to another JSON file,
containing all the keys and values needed to turn it into a YAML file
ready to be a Swagger documentation

P.S.: I know the code for reading the json file is extremely poor and ugly, but i wanted this to work in a specific case and now I'm refactoring this, but i don't have so much time rn... but it's in progress!
